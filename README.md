# Fast-port-scanner-in-python3
This is my first official project in github  , As i try to deepen my networking knowledge via practical programming 

just clone the repsoitory to your local machine ,
but preferably create a python virtual environment , and clone the repo there , 

To do that :
python3 -m venv (name of your environment) 

then : 
git clone   https://github.com/husa45/Fast-port-scanner-in-python3 

Enjoy !!!
